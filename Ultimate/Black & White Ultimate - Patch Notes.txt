v1.00	- Initial Release!

v1.01   - (Hard Mode) Fixed issue with AI where Creature would constantly attack a town.
        - (Hard Mode) Adjusted AI to not make decisions as fast. The previous speed resulted in permanent creature attacks.
        - (Hard Mode) Nerfed Lethys's Lightning Bolt on Land 2 (around 50%).
        - Removed Crocodile from the rock throwing quest. This was a bug.
		
v1.02   - (Hard Mode) Adjusted AI when freezing/itchy a Creature. The creature will now have a few seconds to act once the freeze/itch has worn off.
        - (Hard Mode) Fixed issue where AI Creatures could constantly break out of Creature fights when attacking a town.
        - (Hard Mode) Fixed issue where Nemesis would instantly capture towns on Land 5.
        - (Hard Mode) Fixed issue that reloading the game would re-enable virtual influence (hand outside of influence).
        - (Hard Mode) Reduced player's influence to 25% (from 33%)
        - (Hard Mode) Reduced the rate of belief to 75% (was 50%). Impressing towns should be a bit easier now. Belief amount/caps remain unchanged.
        - (Hard Mode) Players can now create artifacts. Slower than Normal Mode, but now possible.
        - (Hard Mode) Added event in Land 3 that results in a Game Over if Lethys's influence reaches the player's temple.

v1.03   - Pathing has been "fixed". Villagers will now ignore altitude, meaning they won't try run around (wallhug) tiny hills and get stuck forever etc. However, villagers will now also ignore water (causing them to walk over water), but it's rare enough villagers are in a position to do this. Definitely much better!
        - Custom appearances will now be active during Skirmish Mode. (Custom appreances are only disabled during online Multiplayer Games).
        - Skirmish AI colours/temples will now correctly load.
        - Replaced text references such as "Black & White: Creature Isle" to "Black & White: Ultimate".
        - Beating Land 5 should no longer cause the game to be stuck in day time permanently anymore.
        - Khazar now gives the workshop at beginning of Land 2, rather than after building the worship site. 
        - (Hard Mode) Pause is no longer disabled during the stats screen (ESC) or while in the temple. Only manually Pausing the game is disabled now (pressing P). 
        - (Hard Mode) AI speed increased.
        - (Hard Mode) AI will now create more disciples, making their towns much more efficient/larger etc.
        - (Hard Mode) AI shouldn't place weird/random buildings anymore.
        - (Hard Mode) AI Creature actions (Capture, Attack etc.) cooldown has been reduced.
        - (Hard Mode) Fixed issue where Lethys would permanently have the incorrect Symbol on Land 3.

        - (Hard Mode) Fixed issue where AI would occasionally have the incorrect symbol when entering a new land.

        - (Hard Mode) Lethys Creature won't leave after Khazar is killed but will now leave when the player's creature is captured by Lethys.
        - (Hard Mode) Added event in Land 2 that results in a Game Over if Lethys's influence reaches the player's temple.
        - (Hard Mode) All towns will now only require 1,000 belief to capture.
        - (Hard Mode) Increased player's influence back to 33% (from 25%). This is due to the AI upgrade.
