3.	Windows will automatically detect the CD and begin the installation. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Black & White Creature Isle, specifying your original Black & White folder. If you need to install DirectX 8.0a, you can do this as part of the installation. Black & White Creature Isle will then be ready to play.

3. DirectX

If you try to run the game without DirectX7.0a or a later version installed, you will receive the following error message: 

"You need DirectX 7 or greater to play Black & White".


If you try to run the Black & White Creature Isle Setup application without DirectX7.0a installed, you will receive the following error message: 

"There is a problem with your DirectX subsystem"


If you receive either or both of these messages, you need to install DirectX. For your convenience, we have included DirectX8.0a on the Black & White Creature Isle CD.


a) Installing DirectX8.0a directly from CD (if you skipped it during game install)
Black & White Creature Isle comes with DirectX8.0a and will prompt you to install it during installation. If you would like to install it manually, make sure the Black & White Creature Isle CD is in the CD-ROM drive change to the following folder on your CD-ROM drive: 

	"\Directx"

	and double-click on DXSETUP.EXE

b) DirectX8.0a and supported hardware
We recommend that Black & White Creature Isle be run with DirectX compatible sound boards and video cards. While there is a chance that Black & White Creature Isle will run with non-DirectX compatible hardware, you may find that:

	i)   Sound quality suffers.
	ii)  The game runs slower.

11. Gameplay additions
---------------------


Miracle Dispensers - You are able to build your own one-shot Miracle Dispensers by combining six scaffolds created at your workshop. Once placed on the landscape, you can create one-shot Miracles by charging a Miracle in your hand and casting it on the Dispenser. These can be moved from the Dispenser, placed anywhere and saved for later use. You can cast any Miracle on a created Dispenser to create a one-shot Miracle of that type.  


-----------------------------------------------
12. Controller Notes - Touchsense Mouse Support
-----------------------------------------------

TOUCHSENSE MOUSE:
Black & White Creature Isle fully supports the TouchSense technology from Immersion Corporation. 
This functionality is available to anyone who is using a mouse incorporating the TouchSense technology and with the appropriate drivers installed.

TouchSense supplements the visual and audio feedback and gives players of Black & White Creature Isle a more complete perceptual experience. In the virtual Black & White world, having tactile feedback through the mouse will add realism to the whole game experience while exploring the world and interacting with objects. Pulling up trees, powering up Miracles, stroking or slapping your Creature together with many other interactions all have their associated touch sensations which will add to the overall immersive game experience. 




More details of this technology can be found at www.immersion.com. 
For any users who already have this technology, be sure to check up that you have the latest patches available for Black & White at www.immersion.com/coolsites

TouchSense Technology Support:
There are 3 levels of support to TouchSense that can be set in the Game. 
These are available from the Immersion section on the Game Options screen:
Note: The Default support level is Normal.

	Minimum:	None
	Normal:		Key interactions for the game - with objects, Miracles and your Creature.
	Maximum:	Interaction with all game objects and terrain features as the hand 
			passes over the land.

Note: All TouchSense effects have been balanced with the assumption that the "Strength" on the TouchSense mouse control panel settings has been set to Maximum. Different TouchSense tactile feedback mouse products may feel slightly different, so you may want to make adjustments to the "Strength" setting to best suit your preferences.


It is possible to make your own customisations to the TouchSense sensations. However, this operation is entirely unsupported and so it is advisable to make sure you make backup copies of the original files. First you need to download Immersion Studio, the tool for editing touch effects. This can be found in the SDK section of the Immersion website: http://www.immersion.com/developer 


Then there are 2 files which are used in Black & White Creature Isle. They can be found in .\Lionhead Studios Ltd\Black & White\Black & Creature Isle\Data\Immersion

Tactile.ifr: 		This contains the TouchSense effects for tactile feedback
		mouse (e.g. Logitech iFeel Mouse).
FullFeedback.ifr:	This contains the force feedback effects for a full force feedback
		mouse (e.g. Logitech Wingman Force Feedback Mouse). 

For additional information on Immersion and other TouchSense-enabled devices please visit Immersion at www.immersion.com or www.immersion.com/entertainment.html.

NB. Users of the Logitech wheel mouse must ensure that they set the middle button activated by pressing the wheel to be the same as the normal middle button action. You can do this by selecting "Mouse" from the control panel and then the "Buttons" tab. The default setting of this during installation is WebWheel which will interfere with the correct operation of Black & White Creature Isle.

Multiplayer - Out Of Synchronisation Recovery Feature
-----------------------------------------------------

If a game goes Out Of Sync, data is transferred to all client machines for an Out Of Sync restart (This may take a few seconds, dependant on the number of people in the game). This feature can be used as follows:


1. LAN
When waiting for a person to join you in an out-of-sync game, have the "Restore Out Of Sync" checkbox turned on. The game will then be in "Out Of Sync" restore mode. You will not be able to change the map (It will be the same map as the Out Of Sync game). You will only be able to change teams and start the game.


2. Internet
When creating a channel, have the "Restore Out Of Sync" checkbox turned on (this will only be visible if you have an Out Of Sync restore available).

Only people with the Out Of Sync restore data, sent around when the game went Out Of Sync, will be able to join you and replay the game. You can change the teams/clans to how they were in the previous session manually.


Note that Out Of Sync Restore can only be used for a multiplayer game, which is created straight after the game that went Out Of Sync. If another multiplayer game is played in the meantime, it is not possible to restore the previous game.
